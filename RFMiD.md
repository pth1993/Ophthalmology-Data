### Dataset Summary

The RFMiD dataset consists of 3200 fundus images captured using three different fundus cameras with 46 conditions annotated through adjudicated consensus of two senior retinal experts. The retinal images were acquired using three different digital fundus cameras, TOPCON 3D OCT-2000, Kowa VX-10ùõº, and TOPCON TRC-NW300 during the period 2009‚Äì2020. They are centered either on the macula or the optic disc (OD). These images are acquired at an Eye Clinic, Sushrusha Hospital, and Center of Excellence in Signal and Image Processing, SGGS Institute of Engineering and Technology both located in Nanded, (M.S.), India.
