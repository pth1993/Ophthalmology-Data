## Dataset Description

- **Homepage:** NA
- **Repository:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnavjain1/glaucoma-datasets
- **Paper:** https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9207664

### Dataset Summary

The dataset contains 1020 colored fundus images with binary glaucoma labels and masks of optic disk and cup. Based on the original image, the repo also contains image cropped around the optic disc and images square-cropped and resized. The binary masks are stored in the `G1020.csv` file. 

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

The dataset contains 1020 images in JPG format and corresponding masks in PNG format. The size of images varies. The original images are in the `Images` folder. The upper and lower arches of the images are cropped.

### Data Fields

#### Processed images

There are preprocessed images in the `Images_Cropped`, `NerveRemoved_Images` and `Images_Square` folders. `Images_Cropped` contains image cropped around the optic disc, and the size varies. The images in `NerveRemoved_Images` seems to be the same as `Images_Cropped`, but there are no documentations or note about this. `Images_Square` contains images that are cropped as square and resized to 512x512.

#### Glaucoma diagnosis

`G1020.csv` file contains two columns: 

```
imageID
binaryLabels: 0 for normal and 1 for glaucoma
```
Here `imageID` is the image file name.

#### Disc & Cup Segmentation

Disc and Cup masks are overlaid and stored in the `Masks` folder. Mask images have the same file name as the original images, but in PNG format. The Disc area has grayscale pixel value 1 and Cup has value 2, while the other part is 0.

There are also mask counterparts to the processed images in the `Masks_Cropped` and `Masks_Square` folder. 

### Data Splits
