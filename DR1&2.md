### Dataset Summary

DR1 dataset, together with DR2 dataset, are provided by Department of Ophthalmology, Federal University of São Paulo (Unifesp). For DR1, 1,077 images were manually annotated by three medical specialists and all the images in which the three annotations agree were kept in the final dataset. The images were captured using a TRC-50X (Topcon Inc., Tokyo, Japan) mydriatic camera with maximum resolution of one megapixel (640×480 pixels) and a field of view (FOV) of 45 degree.

For DR2, 520 images are annotated by two medical specialists (none of them worked on the DR1 dataset). The dataset was captured using a TRC-NW8 retinograph with a Nikon D90 camera, creating 12.2 megapixel images, which were then reduced to 857×569 pixels.

Images in DR1 and DR2 are annotated with DR-related lesions (6 types for DR1 and 4 types for DR2).

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

DR1: 1,077 images in TIF format with 640x480 resolution
DR2: 520 images in JPG format with 857×569 resolution

### Data Fields

DR1 images have annotations for normal + 6 lesions:
```
Cotton-wool Spots  
Deep Hemorrhages   
Drusen  
Hard Exudates  
Normal Images  
Red Lesions  
Superficial Hemorrhages
```
Images are put in different folders, one image can contain multiple lesions, they are duplicated.

DR2 images have annotations for normal + 4 lesions
```
Cotton-wool Spots   
Drusen  
Hard Exudates  
Normal Images  
Red Lesions
```
The DR2 dataset has an additional annotation in `DR2-images-by-referral` indicating the need for referral by the patient for follow-up by an ophthalmologist in the following 12 months after retinal assessment. Details about the annotation are presented in Fusion (referral vs. non-referral classification).

There are also additional subfolders, including `DR1-additional-marked-images`, `markings`. However, their meaning is not clearly specified.
