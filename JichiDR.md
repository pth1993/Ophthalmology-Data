### Dataset Summary

9,939 posterior pole photographs from 2,740 patients with diabetes. Non-mydriatic 45° field color fundus photographs were taken of four fields in each eye annually at Jichi Medical University between May 2011 and June 2015 on between one and four separate occasions. The images are cropped to the FOV and resized to 848x848.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

9939 fundus images of size 848x848 in JPG format. The naming convention of files is not mentioned, but it should be `{pid}_{seq}_{eye}.jpg` with `{pid}` the ID of patient, `{seq}` the sequence number of the image from the same patient, and `{eye}` be either `L` or `R`.

### Data Fields

The metadata can be found in `list.csv`. Each image has two DR grades:

```
Image // file name
Davis_grading_of_concatenated_figures
Davis_grading_of_one_figure
```

`Davis_grading_of_concatenated_figures` is the DR grading when the grader see a concatenated image generated by stitching 4 fundus images to form a wider field, and `Davis_grading_of_one_figure` is the score for the single image. The grade can be no DR (ndr), simple DR (sdr), pre-proliferative DR (ppdr), and proliferative DR (pdr).
